I'm a Financial Engineering graduate with a strong interest in tech and quantitative finance.  
I build Python/Streamlit tools for derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and trading strategy.  
Currently collaborating with **Hugo Delatte** (Skfolio) and working on a **Portfolio Optimization app** requested by **OpenBB**.

**Open to Quant/Trading opportunities – ideally in New York, but flexible globally.**  
Always learning – if you have feedback or ideas, I’d love to hear from you!
